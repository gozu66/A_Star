#Procedural Cave Generationa and A* pathfinding
My implementation of the A* path-finding algorithm and procedural 2D cave generation system using the marching Squares algorithm

With help from [Sebastian Lague's](https://github.com/SebLague) A* [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0cq5Umv3pMC9SPnKjfp9eGW), and his Procedural Cave Generation series ([GitHub](https://github.com/SebLague/Procedural-Cave-Generation) | [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eZgMK_DT5_biRkWXftAOf9))
